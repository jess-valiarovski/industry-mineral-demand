📌 1. Project Overview
The transition from fossil fuels to low or zero-carbon energy is a major challenge for clean energy industries. This project examines how mineral demand varies across industries using linear regression, bootstrapping, and pairwise statistical tests to provide robust insights into demand patterns. 

Objectives:
✅ Test Hypothesis: Does mineral demand significantly differ across industries?
✅ Compare Statistical Methods: Linear modeling vs. resampling techniques.
✅ Apply Statistical Modeling: ANOVA, bootstrapping, and multiple comparisons to detect industry-specific trends.

🔬 Dataset Source: International Energy Agency (IEA) Critical Minerals Survey 2023
📊 Data Type: Mineral demand in kilotons (kT) per industry

🛠️ 2. Methods & Tools
🔍 Statistical Methods Applied:
Data Cleaning & Transformation: dplyr, tidyverse, janitor
Statistical Modeling: lm() for linear modeling and bootstrapping
Multiple Comparisons: Holm’s correction
Effect Size Analysis: Cohen’s d

📊 Data Visualization (ggplot2):
✅ Violin plots for demand distributions
✅ Bootstrapped confidence intervals to highlight sampling variability
✅ Pairwise comparisons with Holm correction to identify significant differences

📌 3. Key Findings & Visuals
🛠 Key Results from Statistical Analysis:
📌 Industry sector influences mineral demand significantly (p = 0.0395 < 0.05, F = 2.9391).
📌 The Electric Vehicles (EVs) industry has the highest demand, while Hydrogen Technologies industry has the lowest.
📌 Bootstrapped confidence intervals show that all industries significantly differ. Without bootstrapping, industry demand appears similar-likely due to low sample sizes.

📌 5. Next steps!
- Identify which minerals each industry uses the most (e.g. Copper, selenium)
  and compare the data to global resource scarcity and mining burden/benefits
- Try out Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainty
